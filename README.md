<h2 style="color:#777;">1. Project's description</h2>
<details><summary><i>Expand</i></summary>
Diabetes and prediabetes are national epidemics impacting more than 133 million Americans, and diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic diseases in the world (<a href="https://diabetes.org/about-us/annual-reports">source</a>). Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable by taking several simple steps: keeping weight under control, exercising more, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking (<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/disease-prevention/diabetes-prevention/preventing-diabetes-full-story">source</a>). This project involves CDC healthcare statistics and information gathered from lifestyle surveys. The data I am working with includes basic demographics and health questionnaire responses from participants, where they answer questions about their activities, lifestyle, health indicators, and their diabetes condition (diabetes, pre-diabetes, or healthy). The information has been adjusted for binary classification and has only two possible outcomes: diabetes or healthy. The objective of this project is to create a machine learning classification model that is capable of predicting the probability of contracting diabetes based on health and lifestyle data. The purpose of this project is to raise awareness about diabetes and encourage people to adopt a healthier lifestyle.
